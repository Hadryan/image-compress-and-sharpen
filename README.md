# Image Compress & Sharpen
Change the default WordPress compression rate for JPGs, and optionally sharpen images. Forked from the [Sharpen Resized Images plugin](http://unsalkorkmaz.com/ajx-sharpen-resized-images/).


## How It Works
Getting started with Image Compress & Sharpen is as simple as installing a plugin:

1. Upload the `image-compress-and-sharpen` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Pat yourself on the back.

Seriously, you're done. Nice work! You can adjust the default compression rate under "Media" in the Admin Dashboard.
